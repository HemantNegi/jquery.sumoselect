##Requirements
jQuery 1.8.3+ (It is always recommended to use the latest version of jQuery)


##Desktop Browser Support
IE8+, Firefox 4+, Chrome, Safari 4+, Opera 11+ (Other browsers may work, but I did not test on them)


##Mobile/Tablet Browser Support
iOs 3+, Android 2.1+ , Windows Mobile (Other browsers may work, but I did not test on them)


##Forking
If you find that you need a feature that SumoSelect does not currently support, either let me know via the SumoSelect issue tracker, or fork SumoSelect on Github and easily extend SumoSelect to create your own widget!

##Usage

*To just go with the default options simply do*

```javascript
 $(document).ready(function () {
            $('.SlectBox').SumoSelect();
     });
```

*To provide optional settings, simply pass settings object to SumoSelect()*

```javascript
 $(document).ready(function () {
            $('.SlectBox').SumoSelect({placeholder: 'This is a placeholder', csvDispCount: 3 });
        });
```

If you want a instance to the SumoSelect object to call handler methods

```javascript
 var MySelect;
 $(document).ready(function () {
         MySelect = $('.SlectBox').SumoSelect();
     });
```
*NOTE: SumoSelect returns an array of select elements if there are more than one in the matching selector.*

You can also find the instance to SumoSelect object by directly selecting your select element like
```javascript
	$('select.SlectBox')[0].sumo. .....
```

You can perform all the operations on underlying original select and then reload the UI by 
```javascript
	$('select.SlectBox')[0].sumo.reload();
```

**Settings**

The following settings are available now:

- `placeholder` `(string)`  The palceholder text to be displayed in the rendered select widget (on priority basis). *Maximum priority is given to native placeholder attribute in select tag i.e.  - `<select placeholder="this is a placeholder" />`  - Then the option with disabled and selected attribute i.e. `<option disabled selected value="foo" >`  - Last to to the given placeholder attribute in the settings. *
